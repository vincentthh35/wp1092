### Interesting Points

1. I implemented the feature that GIF would load when rendering the images .
2. If you're checking the above feature, you could use Safari and go to **Develop -> empty cache** and the GIF should be working fine. (Another way is to iterate through images really fast and you would see the GIF)
3. These are the teams that Jeremy Lin has played for since his rookie year.
4. Hopefully I could add another NBA team uniform for him... :pray:
